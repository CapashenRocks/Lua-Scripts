# Misc Files

Jercore misc files- mostly a space for information I don't want to lose, but may not be beneficial for others.
<br><br>

## File: Class and Race info
Contains from 3.3.5 the ClassID, RaceID, Classmask, and Racemask information pulled from the DBCs.
<br><br>

## AddOns
- <ins>JerCore's Tool Tip Item Number</ins>: This addon adds the item number to the tool tips of any item. The .toc of this is for 3.3.5, but details in the lua file on updating that.
<br><br>
- <ins>ZoneLevels</ins>: Adds Zone level ranges to the world map with level text color coded based on difficulty to player (similar to later expansions- Green, Yellow, Red). This was written for 3.3.5 as that did not have this functionality yet.
