# Lua-Scripts
Collection of JerCore lua scripts. Most of these are used on Azerothcore, but have also been tested on modern repacks (lightly).

 <h4>ApplyWorldBuff_SpecificExpire<br></h4>
 <i>Details:</i><br>
 Apply world buff at character login that will expire at a specific date and no loger apply it. This uses a custom spell I made for Fall Celebration (this was an xp buff) and thus needs to be edited to your spell.<br><br>

<h4>
  AutoSellVT<br></h4>
 <i>Details:</i><br>
  Ported from my C++ azerothcore custom script. This script upon looting any gray items will auto sell them at a set multiplier rate above standard vendor pricing (unless the multiplier is adjusted to 1.0). 
  
  <br>There is a small chance this fails and player loses the item, but also a chance for a huge jackpot sale that will more than mitigate any lost items, in theory. Designed to add fun and flavor. 
  
  <br>Version 2.0 added an NPC (need to change the one in the script is my custom NPC) as well as a command to toggle on/off anywhere in the game world. Updated with a configuration option to turn off the full chat messages for those that don't want to see that. 
  
  <br><i>Note- Tested and working on 3.3.5 Azerothcore as well as some modern repacks- 10.2.7 and 11.2.0. Only repack it had an issue with so far in testing was Ashen Order that constantly crashed on looting.</i><br><br>

 <h4>AutoSellVT- ALT Version<br></h4>
 <i>Details:</i><br>
 This version lowers the sale multiplier rates with a possibility to sell under vendor rate for those that enjoy emersion and a more real feel where sometimes these items would be saturated in the market and sell for a lower price. Just a fun alternative for some that like RP.<br><br>

 <h4>NewPlayerStartSpells<br></h4>
 <i>Details:</i><br>
 Add customized spells to new characters on first login. Current spells were for a 11.2.0 repack, change spells if testing/using with an older version.<br><br>
