<h4>
  1. AutoSellVT<br></h4>
 <i>Details:</i><br>
  This script upon looting any gray items will auto sell them at a set multiplier rate above standard vendor pricing. There is a small chance this fails and player loses the item, but also a chance for a huge jackpot sale that will more than mitigate any lost items, in theory. Designed to add fun and flavor. Plan to add a configuration option to turn off the chat messages for those that don't want to see that.<br><br>
 <h4>2. NewPlayerStartSpells<br></h4>
 <i>Details:</i><br>
 Add customized spells to new characters on first login.<br><br>
