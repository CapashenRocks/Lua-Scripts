# Lua-Scripts
Collection of Jercore lua scripts (more to come, initial release)

<h4>
  1. AutoSellVT<br></h4>
 <i>Details:</i><br>
  This script upon looting any gray items will auto sell them at a set multiplier rate above standard vendor pricing (unless the multiplier is adjusted to 1.0). 
  
  <br>There is a small chance this fails and player loses the item, but also a chance for a huge jackpot sale that will more than mitigate any lost items, in theory. Designed to add fun and flavor. Updated with a configuration option to turn off the full chat messages for those that don't want to see that. 
  
  <br>Version 2.0 added an NPC (need to change the one in the script is my custom NPC) as well as a command to toggle on/off anywhere in the game world. 
  
  <br><i>Note- tested and working on 3.3.5 Azerothcore as well as 10.2.7 and 11.2.0. Only repack it had an issue with so far in testing was Ashen Order.</i><br><br>

 <h4>2. NewPlayerStartSpells<br></h4>
 <i>Details:</i><br>
 Add customized spells to new characters on first login. Current spells were for a 11.2.0 repack, change spells if testing/using with an older version.<br><br>
